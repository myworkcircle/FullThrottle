I have paste the snippet for differently populated activityperiods value as 1st one has only 1 record while second one has 3 acitvity records

Database Models used
User:

Having Fields as follow

    id (primary key, uuid-field, unique=true)
    real_name (Char-field, max length 100)
    tz for timezone (Char-field, max length 100,)

ActivityPeriod:

ActivityPeriod is a simple Django model having:

    member (Foreign Key to User model)
    start_time (DateTimeField)
    end_time (DateTimeField)

Hosting locally:

Step-1: Clone the repo to your system.

Step-2: run virtualenv -p python3 env

Step-3: run pip install -r requirements.txt 

Make sure DEBUG is True for running locally.

Step-7 Run command: python manage.py makemigrations

Step-8 Run command: python manage.py migrate

Step-9 Run command: python manage.py populate 10

Step-10 Run command: python manage.py runserver

Steps for Cloud services in this case hosted on PythonAnywhere

    Make sure DEBUG is False
    ALLOWED_HOST is configured according to usecase
    command: python manage.py collectstatic for collecting all the static files in the folder mentioned in STATIC_ROOT

# API View

Class based API for serving get request. Here get function first makes a query to database for all the User model and than pass the List of all Users to the the UserSerializer

class FetchDetails(ListAPIView):

    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
    def list(self,request,format=None):
        queryset = self.get_queryset()
        serializer = UserSerializer(queryset, many=True)
        return Response({'ok':True,'members':serializer.data})
        
 Alternatively we can use function based view as well as viewsets to serve the same purpose:-
 
 using function based view:-
 
 @api_view(['GET'])
 
    def fetch_details(request):
        user = User.objects.all()
        user_list = []
        for i in range(len(user)):
            serializer = UserSerializer(user[i])
            user_list.append(serializer.data)
        return Response({'ok':True,'members':user_list})
        
 Using viewsets:-
 
 class FetchDetails(ModelViewSet):
 
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
    def list(self,request):
        queryset = User.objects.all()
        serializer = UserSerializer(queryset,many=True)
        return Response({'ok':True,'members':serializer.data})

# Custom Management Command to populate the database

This command fills the database with the dummy data.

command: **python manage.py populate x**

where x will be how many dummy objects we want to create . (ex:- python3 manage.py populate 10)

Command will be creating  User objects and each user will have 3 activity periods.

Custome command file **populate.py** resides at **task/management/commands/populate.py

For random string generation, I have used **''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_uppercase, k=10))

TimeZone(tz) by a tuple of already provided timezones by pytz

Ps :- I haven't made two seperated apps for user and activity cause it was mentioned to make one app, though i know it is better practise to have two seperate apps for user and other things
